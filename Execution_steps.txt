Steps to excecute the project - 

1) Extract the folders 'flaskpractice' and 'Capstone_mobile_app'

2) Open terminal and go to the folder 'flaskpractice'

3) Once inside the folder in terminal we need to enable virtual environment.

4) To enable virtual environment run the following command 'venv\scripts\activate'

5) Once virtual environment is enabled open 'requirements.txt' from the zip file

6) Install all the required libraries in the virtual environment using pip

7) Once libraries are installed, run the flask web application

8) To run the web application go to 'flaskpractice' on your terminal and use the command 'set FLASK_APP=app.py'

9) Then excecute the command 'flask run --host=0.0.0.0'

10) Use 'ipconfig' on terminal to find local ipv4 address

11) Ensure that your mobile device and desktop are connected to same wifi

12) Go to your web browser and type in your ip followed by ':5000/' for eg '192.168.0.114:5000/'

Steps to excecute the final mobile app

1) Once the flask web application is up and running open android studio

2) In android studio import project 'Capstone_mobile_app' 

3) After importing go to the java folder in the top left corner, then go to 'capstone.proj.app' and open the 'MainActivity.java' file

4) In the 'MainActivity.java' file go to line 56 and change the URL to your localhost ip address that was previously used in 'step 12'

5) After making these changes run the 'MainActivity.java' file by pressing run button or use 'Shift +F10'

6) Running it in this method will display the app on the android emulator

7) To run the app on a mobile device first allow 'USB debugging' on the device by enabling 'Developer options'

8) Now connect your phone to the desktop via USB cable and run the 'MainActivity.java' file 

9) This will start Gradle Build Running and Install the app on your phone

10) Please note that the mobile device and desktop/laptop should be connected to the same Wifi network
